A local instance of cookie clicker needs to be hosted on port 2223 in order for this automated cookie clicker program to work
this project is made in uv.
so install necessary dependencies with "uv sync" and then run the program with: uv run main.py. 
if you already have a save file you want to automate place it into the data folder and rename it save_data.
